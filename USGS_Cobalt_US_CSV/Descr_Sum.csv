The magnetite-chalcopyrite ore was formed as a replacement of limestone overlying the diabase sheet. The two major orebodies are separated by a hump in the upper contact of the diabase sheet.",Rose and others (1985),<Null>
84,TN00001,Mr00037,5/11/2018,Geology,"“Eight massive sulfide ore bodies occur in highly folded and metamorphosed graywacke, graywacke conglomerate, mica schist, chlorite-garnet schist, and staurolite schist of Precambrian age…The ore deposits, ranging in size from 250,000 tons to over 20 million tons, are composed principally of the minerals pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and magnetite. Gangue minerals are quartz, calcite, actinolite, tremolite, hornblende, garnet, and masses of schistose wall rock…Ore genesis is considered to be hydrothermal replacement of receptive beds, predominantly highly calcareous zones, quartzitic zones, and brecciated shear zones. Ore deposition is thought to have occurred during the Devonian Period, with later mobilization and recrystallization of the ore and gangue during Middle and Late Paleozoic times.”",Magee (1968),<Null>
85,TN00001,Mr00037,5/11/2018,Production,"“Today, the Tennessee Copper Company, a division of the Tennessee Corporation, a subsidiary of the Cities Service Company, is the operator of all mines and production facilities in the Ducktown District. The Tennessee Copper Company produces annually more than 1,500,000 tons of sulfide ore from five mines. The ore is milled, and concentrates of copper, iron, and zinc sulfides and iron oxide occurring as magnetite are recovered. Small quantities of lead sulfide have been recovered during milling experiments, and also a small amount in gold and silver is recovered from smelted copper. Products from the complex ores include metallic copper, iron oxide sinter, sulfuric acid, zinc concentrates, sulfur dioxide, copper sulfate, and a host of related chemical products.”",Magee (1968),<Null>
